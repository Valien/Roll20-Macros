# Roll20-Macros
Just some Roll20.net macros that I've found/created/use for Roll20 D&amp;D.

`Initiative-Roll` - simple macro that let's you run Initiative without opening the NPC character sheet.

`Target-Prompt` - if using D&D5e put this in the Attack description on the character sheet. It prompts you for the target you are attacking. Very cool. See https://wiki.roll20.net/Running_D%26D5e_on_Roll20 for reference.
